Fluffy Pancakes
SIMPLE. EASY. QUICK. FLUFFY. The Best Fluffy Pancakes recipe you will fall in love with.
Breakfast
2 cups all purpose | plain flour
1/4 cup granulated sugar or sweetener
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cups milk, (440ml)
1/4 cup butter, (60g | 2 oz)
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 large egg
Instructions
Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.
Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay).
Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle.
Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan. Pour Â¼ cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.
When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.
